# Tailwind CSS Practice – CDN & CLI Setup

Welcome to my **Tailwind CSS Practice** repository!  
This project includes my experiments and learning examples using **Tailwind CSS**, both with **CDN-based setup** and **CLI-based build process**.


## What’s Inside

### CDN-PRAC Version

- No setup required, uses Tailwind via CDN link
- Ideal for quick prototypes and simple demos
- Includes examples of:
  - Utility classes
  - Layouts (flexbox, grid)
  - Typography
  - Buttons, cards, navbars

### CLI Version

- Set up using Tailwind CLI (`npx tailwindcss init`)
- Custom `tailwind.config.js` for extending themes
- CSS compiled from `src/input.css` to `src/output.css`

## Getting Started (CLI Version)

`bash`
- `npm install -D tailwindcss`
- `npx tailwindcss init`
- `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch`
 
# Purpose

This helps me:
- Learn and master Tailwind utility-first workflow
- Compare CDN and CLI approaches
- Build reusable UI components with minimal custom CSS

# Contributions
